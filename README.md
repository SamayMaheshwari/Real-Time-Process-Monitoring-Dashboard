üñ•Ô∏è Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard

üìå Introduction
The Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard is a graphical tool designed to provide system administrators with real-time insights into system processes, CPU usage, and memory consumption. A process monitoring dashboard is essential for managing system performance efficiently, enabling users to identify performance bottlenecks, monitor trends, and take necessary actions such as terminating unresponsive processes. Traditional process monitoring tools often provide static or periodic updates, but this project aims to introduce a real-time solution with dynamic visualization and alert mechanisms.
This dashboard will leverage modern technologies like AI-driven anomaly detection, Web Sockets for real-time updates, and interactive visualization to offer an intuitive and efficient experience for users. By continuously tracking and analysing system processes, the tool ensures optimal resource allocation and helps prevent system slowdowns or crashes.
